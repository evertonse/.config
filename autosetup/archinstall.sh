# New linux user here, and this was my experience following this tutorial: 
#
# The tutorial was insanely smooth and easy to follow. Everything went as planned until I realised that grub-install wasn't working. Panicking, I restarted my entire install from the start and encountered the same issue.
#
# If you encounter this problem, there's no need to restart. It's likely because your system is UEFI instead of EFI and that means in the step where you execute "mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot" you actually need to mount to /mnt/boot/efi instead. Unmount it with "umount" , create a new working directory at /mnt/boot/efi with "mkdir", and then execute the mount, this time to the correct directory. After this, grub should install as intended and you can continue with the tutorial.
#
# The next issue I encountered was in the very next step when trying to create a config file for grub, where the console mentioned that linux and initrd images were found, but also issues a warning that "os-prober will not be executed to detect other bootable partitions" if you get this issue, what you need to do is change some of grub's default settings. This is done by executing "vim /etc/default/grub" and look for the setting "GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false" which is probably commented out. You need to uncomment it (ie. enable os prober).
#
# After resolving those two issues, the rest of the install continued smoothly and i managed to arrive at the fabled ASCII Arch logo. Hope my experience helps anyone encountering the same issues.
#
# edit: Oh also, for the peeps using wifi, if wifi menu doesn't work, search how to use iwctl instead
